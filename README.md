Fapsoft Math Tools is a collection of various math-related programs ive made either for fun or derived from excercises.
It is updated very infrequently, but as of October 2015 it includes a P Value calculator, a Roman/Arabic numeral converter,
a prime number checker, and a matrix determinant calculator.
