# Fapsoft-Math-Tools
Fapsoft Math Tools is a collection of various math-related programs I've made either for fun or derived from excercises.
It is updated very infrequently, but as of October 2015 it includes a P Value calculator (for statistics), a Roman/Arabic numeral converter, a prime number checker, and a matrix determinant calculator. 
Will be adding new feature in the coming years that displays certain useful, yet often forgotten, math theorems such as 0 + 0 != 1, 0 + 0 = 0, and many many others.
